### Q2: What is the importance of using a validation set?

Replace this text with your answer (should be between 2-4 sentences).

### Q3: Assuming a binary classification setting, describe what false negative rate and false positive rate represents in the context of this dataset, and how they impact a system in which the NIDS is deployed.

### Q4: What differences did you observe between the decision tree models and the neural networks? What are some pros and cons of using each model from a security perspective?

Replace this text with your answer (should be between 2-4 sentences).

### Q5: Between decision trees and neural networks, which model would you recommend using in security sensitive domains and why? There are no wrong answers here, but answer should be supported with sufficient justification.

### Q6: What did you notice when switching from the binary classification to multiclass classification setting? How does that impact security?

Replace this text with your answer (should be between 2-4 sentences).

### Q7: What information does an NIDS (and therefore the system admins) need to access to be effective, and how does that relate to the privacy of users accessing the network?
