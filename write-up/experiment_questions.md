# Experiment 1 - Decision Tree on Binary Classification

Complete with command to run on test set: `./642test-$(uname -p) <MODEL_FILE_NAME> <THRESHOLD>`

### Q1: What hyperparameters did you vary, and what values did you try? What were some trends you observed?

### Q2: Provide an image of the trained decision tree. Discuss what you observe.
